                    <p>We will have weekly classes on chemistry-related topics. Over the course of the year, we plan to move from the basics like Atomic Structure, Chemical Bonding, and the Periodic Table to advanced topics such as Quantum Chemistry, Organic Chemistry, and Biochemistry.</p>
                    <p>While we do have an overall outline of what topics we want to cover, we are open to suggestions from you on anything you find interesting and want to learn more about.</p>
                    <p>Our mission is to show that Chemistry isn’t just a subject — it’s a lens to see how the world works, how molecules move, and how discovery feels.</p>

                    <p><strong>The Seaborg Series</strong> is a collection of lectures designed to introduce you to the world of Chemistry.</p>

                    <h2 class="overview-card-title">Guest Speakers & Instructors</h2>
                    <p>Between the lectures, students will attend seminars by young researchers who will share insights from their own Chemistry research and the questions that excite them most.These talks are meant to make students aware of what’s happening in the world of chemistry today — the discoveries, the challenges, and the people behind them — helping them realize that research is simply curiosity taken seriously.

                    <p>All lectures and seminars will be recorded and shared freely, along with slides, so anyone can explore them at their own pace.</p>

                    <h2 class="overview-card-title">The Seaborg Community</h2>
                    <p>This initiative is for students who are deeply curious about Chemistry — especially those from low-income backgrounds — who may not yet have seen how far their passion can take them. Whether they already excel or simply show a spark of interest, every student deserves the chance to see themselves in science.</p>
