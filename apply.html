                    <h3>Important Notice</h3>
                    <p>Candidates shortlisted for interviews have been contacted. If you applied for the 2025 cohort but have not received your preliminary decisions, please email us at the address above.</p>

                    <p>These questions are to help us get to know you better, as a person - beyond your scores in contests and beyond how well you can write solutions to our problems. This is your chance to showcase your passion and tell us about why you find the subject so interesting. Don't worry too much and just be yourself!</p>

                    <h2 class="apply-card-title">Problems</h2>
                    <p>The problems, while of varying difficulty, are all certainly not easy. Do not feel discouraged if you are unable to solve some of them - we don't expect you to. What we do want is to see how you think as you approach a problem. So, make sure you submit any and all progress you make on a problem that you don't solve too.</p>
                    <p>Finally, remember that your performance on these problems is only one out of a large number of factors that will affect our decision to select the next Fellows. So don't let that discourage you either.</p>

                <div class="apply-card">
                    <h2 class="apply-card-title">Interviews</h2>
                    <p>Shortlisted candidates will be contacted for a short interview at a time of their convenience. Don't worry about the preparation too much! We don't expect you to know advanced theorems. All we're looking to do is gauge your comfort with some ideas.</p>

                    <p>That's great! Once you are selected to be a Fellow, we will give you access to the discord server as well as other instructions.</p>
